        The 3 magic gemstones

Once upon a time, in the Land of Arzea people were in a deep sorrow and sadness.

They were sad, because they felt sorry for their beautiful princess, Lizzie.

Magion, the Wizard living in Arzea turned the princess into an ugly old lady, so nobody could love her.

Alexander, the Prince of Glicia wanted to rescue Lizzie, because he was in love with her.

The only way he could set the princess free from the evil, was that he had to collect 3 magic gemstones, and defeat Magion with the help of them.

In order to get the very first of the gemstones, he had to answer the Wise Owl's 3 tricky questions.

He was very smart, so answering these questions was easy for him. This is how he got the Ruby.

To get the second one, he had to climb up to the top of the Glass Hill and bring a piece of Black Colored Glass.

It was not easy, because the Glass Hill is very slippery, but when he could get on top of it, it was easy to find a piece of black glass. This is how he got the Emerald.

After collecting the first two gemstones, he had to get through the Black Princess's castle with 100 closed doors.

When he was 13 years old, his dead, the king gave him a magic key, that can open any doors. This is why it was easy for the princess to open all the 100 doors. This is how he got the last of the gemstones, the Emerald.

After collecting all the gemstones, Alexander could bravely rescue Lizzie from Magion using the magic gemstones.

...and Lizzie and Alexander could live together happily ever after.
